LONG TERM GOALS:
  TBD

MED PRIORITY:
  - Work with Scott Cutler and Klara Jelinkova to get direct access to evaluation data, and to deploy onto Rice hardware w/ HTTPS

LOW PRIORITY:
  - Implement TourView, an interactive slideshow that explains how to use the application. Add link to open tour on navigation bar as "Help".
    NOTE: As of now, only frame contents need to be implemented; must enable in org.riceapps.SchedulePlannerConfig.

  - Extend context menus with options:
    * Switch Sections (from calendar to calendar)
    * Add/Move To Calendar (from search or playground): needs support for multiple sections

  - Certain courses cannot be displayed on the calendar because they are not scheduled (e.g. research courses). We need to come up with a way to allow these courses to be scheduled by the user. These courses also usually have variable credit hours. Pretty gross.
    NOTE: Currently these can just be placed Sunday @ NOON, but that's a temporary fix.

  - For courses that have only one section: allow the course to just be dropped straight onto the calendar and/or list view so that the user doesn't actually have to aim and drop it on the guide views.

  - Add button to toolbar to clear calendar.

  - Compatability testing with IE, Firefox, Safari, Opera, iOS Safari, Android Chrome.

  - Integration with RiceApps Atlas for course locations

  - Deprecate the old search view close button + toolbar CRN button.
