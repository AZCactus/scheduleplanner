BACK-END (launch blockers):
  - Performance optimizations and caching when distribution JSON of all courses (probably distribute as static file).

FRONT-END:
  HIGH PRIORITY (launch blockers):

    - Implement the CourseModalView, a popup which displays information about ALL SECTIONS of a given course (when initiated from a course click in the playground view, search view, or calendar view).


  MEDIUM PRIORITY (launch blockers):
    - Search Results: show distribution, location/days, and credit hours in list view

    - Show the number of credits in schedule on the toolbar (broken down for all, D1, D2, D3).

    - Implement the navigation bar (NavigationBarView). The bar should display the user's network ID (obtained from UserModel), a title, a logout link (to /logout).

    - Add an option to export courses for registration (just a pop-up with a list of CRNs that ESTHER requires, inherit from ModalView). This option should be clickable from the Toolbar.

  LOW PRIORITY:
    - Add indicator to courses on calendar that have multiple sections available.

    - Add indicator to courses on calendar for waitlist and enrollment data.

    - Dragging course from playground when search view is open should hide search view while user performs the drag.

    - Synchronization Issues: use UserController to prevent people with multiple open copies of application from breaking things. Current behavior is that synchronized copy matches UI of last window to make a change, which is OK.

    - Implement TourView, an interactive slideshow that explains how to use the application. The tour should be shown to each user automatically the first time they view the application, and should not be shown on subsequent visits (use UserModel hasSeenTour and setHasSeenTour). Add link to open tour on navigation bar as "Help".

    - Add right-click context menu to all course views in calendar, search, and playground w/ options:
      * Switch Sections (from calendar to calendar)
      * Add/Move To Playground (from search or calendar)
      * Add/Move To Calendar (from search or playground)
      * Remove (removes the course from either the calendar or playground) (only for cal/search)
      * View Evaluations (brings up the course evalations page within ESTHER)
      * View Information (brings a course modal view for the given course)

    - Add a list view (similar to the previous schedule planner) so that students can use either view. The list view should appear beneath the calendar view.
      subj, crn, title, cr, dist, room, instructor, enrollment/waitlist for normal and xlist, restrictions

    - Certain courses cannot be displayed on the calendar because they are not scheduled (e.g. research courses). We need to come up with a way to allow these courses to be scheduled. These courses also usually have variable credit hours.

    - Drag and Drop should support touch screen; need to add support for touch events.

    - Add button to toolbar to clear calendar and playground.

    - Compatability testing with IE, Firefox, Safari, Opera.

    - Search Functionality: support for conflicts and hide full filters. See SearchView, CoursesModel.

    - Search Functionality: improvement to sorting (e.g. a search for "COMP" should yield all CS courses in order by ascending course number)

    - Search View: better looking hide (cancel) button
