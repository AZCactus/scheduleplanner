FRONT-END:

  LOW PRIORITY:
    - Synchronization Issues: use UserController to prevent people with multiple open copies of application from breaking things. Current behavior is that synchronized copy matches UI of last window to make a change, which is OK.

    - Implement TourView, an interactive slideshow that explains how to use the application. Add link to open tour on navigation bar as "Help".
      NOTE: As of now, only frame contents need to be implemented; must enable in org.riceapps.SchedulePlannerConfig.

    - Add right-click context menu to all course views in calendar, search, and playground w/ options:
      * Switch Sections (from calendar to calendar)
      * Add/Move To Playground (from search or calendar)
      * Add/Move To Calendar (from search or playground)
      * Remove (removes the course from either the calendar or playground) (only for cal/search)
      * View Evaluations (brings up the course evalations page within ESTHER)
      * View Information (brings a course modal view for the given course)

    - Add a list view (similar to the previous schedule planner) so that students can use either view. The list view should appear beneath the calendar view.
      subj, crn, title, cr, dist, room, instructor, enrollment/waitlist for normal and xlist, restrictions

    - Certain courses cannot be displayed on the calendar because they are not scheduled (e.g. research courses). We need to come up with a way to allow these courses to be scheduled. These courses also usually have variable credit hours.
      NOTE: Currently these can just be placed Sunday @ NOON, but that's a temporary fix.

    - For courses that have only one section: allow the course to just be dropped straight onto the calendar so that the user doesn't actually have to aim and drop it on the guide views.

    - Add button to toolbar to clear calendar.

    - Compatability testing with IE, Firefox, Safari, Opera, mobile.

    - Search Functionality: support for conflicts and hide full filters. See SearchView, CoursesModel.

    - Search View: better looking hide (cancel) button

    - Search View: scroll results to top when they change

    - Integration with RiceApps Atlas for course locations
