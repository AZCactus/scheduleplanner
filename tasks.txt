FRONT-END:
  MED PRIORITY:
    - Search View: better looking hide (cancel) button

    - Search View: scroll results to top when they change. Results not scrollable when re-shown.

    - Extend list view functionality with evaluations data or click for course info.

    - Work with Scott Cutler and Klara Jelinkova to get direct access to evaluation data, and to deploy onto Rice hardware w/ HTTPS.

  LOW PRIORITY:
    - Synchronization Issues: use UserController to prevent people with multiple open copies of application from breaking things. Current behavior is that synchronized copy matches UI of last window to make a change, which is OK.

    - Implement TourView, an interactive slideshow that explains how to use the application. Add link to open tour on navigation bar as "Help".
      NOTE: As of now, only frame contents need to be implemented; must enable in org.riceapps.SchedulePlannerConfig.

    - Add right-click context menu to all course views in calendar, search, and playground w/ options:
      * Switch Sections (from calendar to calendar)
      * Add/Move To Playground (from search or calendar)
      * Add/Move To Calendar (from search or playground)
      * Remove (removes the course from either the calendar or playground) (only for cal/search)
      * View Evaluations (brings up the course evalations page within ESTHER)
      * View Information (brings a course modal view for the given course)

    - Certain courses cannot be displayed on the calendar because they are not scheduled (e.g. research courses). We need to come up with a way to allow these courses to be scheduled. These courses also usually have variable credit hours.
      NOTE: Currently these can just be placed Sunday @ NOON, but that's a temporary fix.

    - For courses that have only one section: allow the course to just be dropped straight onto the calendar and/or list view so that the user doesn't actually have to aim and drop it on the guide views.

    - Add button to toolbar to clear calendar.

    - Compatability testing with IE, Firefox, Safari, Opera, mobile.

    - Integration with RiceApps Atlas for course locations
