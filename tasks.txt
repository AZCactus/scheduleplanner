MEDIUM PRIORITY:
  - Work with Scott Cutler and Klara Jelinkova to get direct access to evaluation data, and to deploy onto Rice hardware w/ HTTPS.
    - Add additional search filters based on evaluations data.
    - Note: We have been allocated a Rice server and SSL certificate by IT. Need to migrate the app to this server.

LOW PRIORITY:

  - Add an option to export courses placed on calendar to Google Calendar (on a recurring weekly basis for that semester).

  - Implement TourView, an interactive slideshow that explains how to use the application. Add link to open tour on navigation bar as "Help".
    - NOTE: As of now, only frame contents need to be implemented; must enable in org.riceapps.SchedulePlannerConfig.

  - Extend context menus with options:
    * Switch Sections (from calendar to calendar)
    * Add/Move To Calendar (from search or playground): needs support for multiple sections

  - Certain courses cannot be displayed on the calendar because they are not scheduled (e.g. research courses). We need to come up with a way to allow these courses to be scheduled by the user. These courses also usually have variable credit hours. Pretty gross.
    - NOTE: Currently these can all just be placed Sunday @ NOON, but that's a temporary fix.

  - For courses that have only one section: allow the course to just be dropped straight onto the calendar and/or list view so that the user doesn't actually have to aim and drop it on the guide views.

  - Add button to toolbar to clear the calendar.

  - Compatability testing with IE, Firefox, Safari, Opera, iOS Safari, Android Chrome.

  - Integration with RiceApps Atlas for course locations.

  - Remove the code for old search view close button + toolbar CRN button.

  - Add "Sort By" dropdown to the search results.

  - Add a min/max credit hours search filter.

  - Fix DraggableView so that all event listeners are uninstalled when isDraggable=false and installed when isDraggable=true.
